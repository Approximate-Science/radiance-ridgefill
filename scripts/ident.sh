# ident.sh -- is this server reproducible? One hash per (temperature, question), so a run can be
# compared against another run of the SAME configuration.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES: run-to-run determinism at a fixed configuration, across restarts. On
# Qwen3.8-Flash-Next at tp2 with the MTP head at depth 3, two servers started from scratch give
# the same six hashes: temperature 0, 0.7 and 1.0, both questions.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE: that a SPECULATIVE run matches a NON-SPECULATIVE one byte for byte.
# `narrow_ksplit` chooses the split count of the fp8 GEMM's finisher from M, so the same row
# computed at M=1 (one token at a time) and at M=8 (a verify block) is not bit-identical, and a
# long answer can flip a near-tie somewhere past its first few hundred characters, both
# continuations equally good. `--deterministic` does not change that -- it pins placement and
# never reaches a kernel.
#
# BUT A SHORT COMMON PREFIX IS A DEFECT, NOT A TIE. On Qwen3.8-Flash-Next at tp2, depth 3 against
# --num-speculative-tokens 0 gives the same six hashes here, and over longer answers the two agree
# for hundreds of characters before any flip. A speculative run that leaves the non-speculative
# text within the first sentence or two is computing something different after a rejected draft --
# rolling state read from a rejected token is exactly that shape -- and is worth bisecting. If
# byte-identity across that boundary is ever required everywhere, the work is plumbing a pinned
# split count into the fp8 GEMM, and it costs throughput at one M or the other.

#
# Adapted from radiance scripts/ident.sh (tag v1.0.8, commit 140987f, unmodified logic; radiance's file is
# unchanged through v1.1.1, 7001841):
# the port comes from RK_PORT (default 8100, scripts/common.sh) instead of P, so it
# follows this repo's scripts/serve.sh. Run three times across restarts for the
# reproducibility gate (HANDOVER §5 Stage 0 step 4).
